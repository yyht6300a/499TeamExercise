1. Sorting in Ascending order
    To use this function, we need to create a Int_ascending object and use object.ascending(input value). The input value is an unsorted integer array. The function will sort the input array in ascending order. and Test_int_ascending class use a JUnit test to ensure the function can work properly 


2. Sorting in Descending Order
    Originally Collections.Sort sorts integer elements in an array by ascending order, by overriding "compare()", SortDes.java makes Collections.Sort sort integer in descending order. Additionally, SortDescTest.java provides unit tests to make sure that testing in descending order works.
