1. Sorting in Ascending order:
    To use this function, we need to create a Int_ascending object and use object.ascending(input value). The input value is an unsorted integer array. The function will sort the input array in ascending order. and Test_int_ascending class use a JUnit test to ensure the function can work properly 


2. Sorting in Descending Order:
    Originally Collections.Sort sorts integer elements in an array by ascending order, by overriding "compare()", SortDes.java makes Collections.Sort sort integer in descending order. Additionally, SortDescTest.java provides unit tests to make sure that testing in descending order works.

3. Sorting Strings in Descending Order
    To use this function, call StringSorterDesc.sortStringsDesc(String[]). The input is an array of strings, and the output is a new array of strings sorted in descending order. The bubble sort algorithm is used to sort the strings. StringSorterDescTest.java is included to make sure the sortStringsDesc functions as intended.

4. Sorting String in Ascending Order
    To use this function, first create a String sorter. This sorter will be used to sort an arraylist of 'msg' objects. The sorter will obtain the content of each msg elements and sort them in ascending order. The output is the same Arraylist but with each msg sorted by content in Ascending order.
